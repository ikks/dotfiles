This script creates a zip file with appropiate structure to train
piper voices from an origin file from the openslr project.

It will downsample the original files 

We require a .zip file downloaded from https://www.openslr.org/
We will create a file.lj.zip file inside this same directory,
we need to be able to write to a temp dir during the process and current
directory.  Download the zip file and run the script where the
zip file was downloaded.  Please do it in a clean directory with
only the downloaded zip file.

The file expects an structure like the one in https://www.openslr.org/72/

We will need you to have installed unzip, zip, gawk, fd and sox

In Debian you can issue to make sure they are installed
 sudo apt install unzip gawk fd-find sox
