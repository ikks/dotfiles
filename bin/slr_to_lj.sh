This script creates a zip file with appropiate structure to train
piper voices from an origin file from the openslr project.

Many wavs and a tsv with two columns, the first is the name of the
wav file and the second is the transcription.

The original files are downsampled to 22050 Hz.

The resulting zip file contains:
 * a LICENSE file
 * a metadata.csv two column file
 * a _transcription.txt for multivoice piper training three column
 file
 * a piper_voice.txt two column file for each voice with the 
 transcription.
 * a subdirectory wavs/ with wav files downsampled to 22050 hz

We require a .zip file downloaded from https://www.openslr.org/
We will create a file.lj.zip file inside this same directory.
Download the zip file and run the script where the zip file was
downloaded.  Please do it in a clean directory with only the
downloaded zip file.

We will need you to have installed unzip, zip, gawk, fd and sox

In Debian you can issue
 sudo apt install unzip gawk fd-find sox
to install the required packages.
